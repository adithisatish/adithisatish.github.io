I am a Master's graduate from the **Technical University of München**, where I specialized in **Data Engineering and Analytics**. For my master thesis, I explored how LLMs can be used to address challenges like data scarcity and popularity bias in these recommender systems, (take a look at it [here!](../files/thesis.pdf))

In addition to my academics, I've worked at **Siemens AG** since March 2023, first, as a working student, building Python and NLP pipelines to streamline data processing and analysis in the financial and sustainability domains. Since November 2025, I've been working full-time at the **EHS AI Lab** at Siemens, where I build AI solutions and drive innovation and automation in the domains of environment protection, health management, and safety. 

I'm also currently researching **leveraging LLMs to balance sustainability and personalization in tourism recommender systems** at the [Chair of Connected Mobility](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/cm/home/) at TUM. 

When I'm not staring into the abyss that is my VS Code editor, I love travelling and experiencing different cultures, which I somewhat-punctually document on my [Wanderlog](https://wanderlog.com/u/adithisatish) profile.🧳✈️ During the time in between vacations, I enjoy swimming, reading, and café-hopping to find the perfect _Kaffee (read: Tee) und Kuchen_ spot in Munich. ☕️🍰
