Hi! I am Adithi, a Master's student specializing in **Data Engineering and Analytics** at the **Technical University of Munich**.

I am currently working on l**everaging LLMs to balance diversity and personalization in tourism recommender systems** at the [Chair of Connected Mobility](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/cm/home/) at TUM.

In addition to my studies, I also work in the Environmental Protection Data Analytics team at **Siemens AG**, where I use NLP to analyze and identify substances of concern from product and chemical descriptions.

When I'm not staring into my VS Code abyss, I love travelling and experiencing different cultures, which I somewhat-punctually document on my [Wanderlog](https://wanderlog.com/u/adithisatish) profile. During those weeks between vacations, I enjoy swimming, reading and cafe-hopping to find the next best Kaffee (read: Tee) und Kuchen spot in Munich.
