I’m a Master’s graduate of the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, where I specialized in **Data Engineering and Analytics**. For my master’s thesis, I explored how large language models (LLMs) can help address challenges such as data scarcity and popularity bias in recommender systems (take a look at it [here!](../files/thesis.pdf)).

Alongside my academic journey, I’ve been working at **Siemens AG** since March 2023. I started as a working student, developing Python- and NLP-based pipelines to streamline data processing and analysis in the financial and sustainability domains. Since November 2025, I’ve been working full-time at the **EHS AI Lab** at Siemens, where I build AI-driven solutions and drive innovation and automation across environmental protection, health management, and workplace safety.

In parallel, I’m currently conducting research at the [Chair of Connected Mobility](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/cm/home/) at TUM, focusing on how LLMs can be leveraged to balance sustainability and personalization in tourism recommender systems.

When I'm not staring into the abyss that is my VS Code editor, I love travelling and immersing myself in different cultures, which I somewhat-punctually document on my [Wanderlog](https://wanderlog.com/u/adithisatish) profile🧳✈️. And when I'm not planning my next holiday, I enjoy swimming, reading, and café-hopping to find the perfect _Kaffee (read: Tee) und Kuchen_ spot in Munich. ☕️🍰
