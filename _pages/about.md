I'm a Master's student specializing in **Data Engineering and Analytics** at the **Technical University of Munich**.

I am currently working on **leveraging LLMs to balance diversity, sustainability and personalization in tourism recommender systems** at the [Chair of Connected Mobility](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/cm/home/) at TUM. For my master thesis, I explored how LLMs can be used to address challenges like data scarcity and popularity bias in these recommender systems, which you can also view [here.](../files/thesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}

In addition to my studies, I also work in the Environmental Protection Data Analytics team at **Siemens AG**, where I use NLP to analyze and identify substances of concern from product and chemical descriptions.

When I'm not staring into the abyss that is my VS Code editor, I love travelling and experiencing different cultures, which I somewhat-punctually document on my [Wanderlog](https://wanderlog.com/u/adithisatish) profile.🧳✈️ During the time in between vacations, I enjoy swimming, reading, and café-hopping to find the perfect _Kaffee (read: Tee) und Kuchen_ spot in Munich. ☕️🍰
